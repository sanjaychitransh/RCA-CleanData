TS017525407,Email - We required high uninitialized Luns/hosts (High workload) and any hardware issues observed at storage end,We required high uninitialized Luns/hosts (High workload) and any hardware issues observed at storage end,DS8900F,AI-1560218,2024-10-14,"Customer Sentiment Not available Description Summary Not Summarized Email - We required high uninitialized Luns/hosts (High workload) and any hardware issues observed at storage end We required high uninitialized Luns/hosts (High workload) and any hardware issues observed at storage end Feed Summary Summary: ICICI Bank requested assistance with high uninitialized LUNs/hosts and potential hardware issues on their DS8900F storage system. IBM Support requested more information about the high uninitialized LUNs/hosts and any observed hardware issues. ICICI Bank provided a time frame for the issue and confirmed there were no open events or hardware issues during that time. They also requested information on which LSS/host were consuming high load during the specified time stamps. IBM Support recommended a bandwidth study of the existing dark fiber links between NDC/ODC and COLO sites and the configuration of Spectrum Control monitoring software to send reports about host workload metrics. IBM Expert Labs team can conduct bandwidth study and configure Spectrum Control reporting. IBM Support also requested spectrum control reports for the time frame 07-10-2024 10:00 - 17:00 hrs from all the 3 storage systems. ICICI Bank later provided spectrum control reports for two of the storage systems and requested analysis. IBM Support analyzed the reports and provided a table with the replication bandwidth for each system during the specified time stamps. The maximum combined send replication bandwidth for the two systems did not exceed 4Gbps, and the maximum send replication bandwidth for the third system did not exceed 2.5Gbps. IBM Support also noted SAN congestion on the metro mirror ports in all three DS8K systems, which could impact the write latency of host applications. They recommended engaging with the SAN Support team to analyze the buffer starvation issue on the metro mirror ports and engaging with link vendors to optimize the link latencies. ICICI Bank later requested information on the sessions running during the specified time frame, but IBM Support noted that session related information is not available in spectrum control performance package. Resolution Summary Confirmed Solution *Generated by watsonx*: The maximum combined send replication bandwidth on systems MR90 and VG20 is 441 MiBps. The link throughput from DC sites to COLO site does not exceed 4Gbps for the problem timestamps. The maximum send replication bandwidth on system MR80 is 280 MiBps. The link throughput from COLO site to DC sites does not exceed 2.5Gbps for the problem timestamps. However, there is SAN congestion on the metro mirror ports in all the 3 DS8K systems, which can have an impact on the write latency of the host applications. Recommendations to resolve the issue include engaging with the SAN Support team to analyze the buffer starvation issue on the metro mirror ports and engaging with link vendors to optimize the link latencies to be as close to each other as possible. No actions are recommended on the DS8K systems. Solution Attempts *Generated by watsonx*: The hardware analysis shows that all 3 DS8K storage systems are operating in optimal status during the specified problem window and there are no hardware issues that can lead to a performance problem. The support team has requested more information, including clarification of what is meant by high uninitialized LUNs/hosts, a list of affected lss/volume IDs/volume group/cluster/host on each DS8K system, and details about the impact to the application due to the reported performance problem.

(first defect) First, when did you activate Storage Insights for the SVC Cluster ? Several years ago. Now since we are under subscription they have deleted out instance every year and I have had to start from scratch until this year. Was it recently ? No Second, let me confirm your statement of the problem. According to what you have written, the issue is: ""There is no performance data for LLX50PS2_P1 I did not even see the pool in the performance tab until I created a volume without a stretch copy. Note before that volume there was no Primary volumes on this pool I need to see all of the read performance to this Pool. The array is being maxed out and I have no performance data available."" Was the word in BOLD intended to be ""Not"" or was is supposed to be ""Note"" ?

That pool was not even listed until I created the dummy volume in the pool so it had a primary disk copy. It is not allocated so there is not any IO to that specific volume however the Pool is being slammed.

TS017414926,[ARI] - 24276 - Mise en place d'un nouveau serveur SMTP sécurisé avec du TLS,"Bonjour, Un client nous a demandé de changer son serveur SMTP pour l'envoi des mails, mais le nouveau serveur nécessite une connexion sécurisée via TLS et nous ne parvenons pas à rajouter un certificat non auto-signé. Les CSR sont créées depuis le DCM (""nouvelle"" version) de la partition, envoyées au client qui génère un certificat, mais ensuite le certificat n'est pas accepté sur le DCM, sous prétexte qu' ""aucune demande n'a été créée pour ce certificat"". De nombreuses tentatives et écrasement de tentatives ont été exécutées, il faudra peut-être réinitialiser le DCM. Pouvez-vous nous aider à créer un certificat valable et à le faire accepter par le DCM ? Y a-t-il d'autres considérations à prendre en compte pour la mise en place d'un nouveau SMTP ? Je vous remercie par avance pour votre retour. Cordialement, Étienne PETIT.",IBM i,AI-1577848,2024-10-16,"Customer Sentiment negative Description Summary The customer is unable to add a non-self-signed certificate to a new secure SMTP server with TLS, as the certificate is not accepted by DCM due to a missing request. The customer has attempted many fixes, including resetting DCM, but the issue remains unresolved. The customer is seeking assistance in creating a valid certificate and having it accepted by DCM, as well as any other considerations for setting up a new SMTP server. Feed Summary Customer was unable to add a non-self-signed certificate to their SMTP server and needed help creating a valid certificate and having it accepted by DCM. The customer was trying to import a certificate to configure SSL/TLS between IBM i and a remote mail router, but encountered an error message that ""no request has been created for this certificate"". The customer had already tried numerous attempts to clear the DCM and restart from scratch. The support team provided instructions for the customer to clear the DCM and configure SMTP, and the customer followed these instructions. However, the customer was still unable to send mail after completing these steps. The support team requested that the customer provide a trace of the SMTP configuration and the job log, as well as the DCM applications and store. The customer provided these files and the support team was able to determine that the issue was due to a problem with TLS (trusted CA) and that the certificate was not signed by a trusted certificate authority. The support team identified that the CA ""GTS Root R1"" was missing and needed to be imported and trusted in the DCM for the Application ID: QIBM\_QTMS\_SMTP\_CLIENT. The customer was able to locate the CA with the serial number provided by the support team, but was unable to find the CA with the serial number ""0203e5936f31b01349886ba217"". The support team was able to confirm that the imported CA was correct and that the issue was due to the IP address of the SMTP server not being the same as the customer's. The support team provided instructions for the customer to run a PING and openssl command to retrieve the IP address of the SMTP server and the certificate chain. The customer provided the spool file and the support team was able to determine that the CA chain was correct and that the issue was due to the SMTP process taking the host name specified for forwarding mailhub server and getting the MX record IP address for it, which was resulting in an invalid.invalid CA and a 6000 error. To resolve the issue, the support team changed the SMTP client APP ID to use only TLSV1.2 and the customer was able to send mail successfully. The customer agreed to close the case.

Resolution Summary Confirmed Solution Not Summarized Solution Attempts Not Summarized: As the message itself indicates IXGLOGR disconnects from the structure normal. Nothing unusual and totally normal processing. I think I see from where the confusion is coming on and I apologize for not being clear enough with my updates. At the time I was doing the analysis of the syslog, I thought the IXC567I message at 22:10:31.75 was the last message in the log containing information about Logger component in it(XCF structure used by CF based log stream). The SETLOGRC LOGSTREAM command I had in mind was issued at 22:38:43.32 and it was mentioned just to indicate start of Logger activity. I think by the time I've put the update, it was clear that the system had experienced I/O issues with devices 7501 where primary LOGR CDS resides and 7702 where the alternate LOGR CDS resides. So the first message that indicates that the system has troubles performing I/O operations to the device with LOGR CDS is: So the system issues that set of messages indicating IO issues at: 22:40:13.86, 22:40:54.86, 22:41:35.88, 22:42:17.89, 22:42:58.90, 22:43:41.92, 22:44:22.93, 22:45:04.94, 22:45:46.96, 22:46:29.97, 22:47:11.97, 22:47:53.99, 22:49:34.03, 22:50:15.37(SYS4) 22:50:16.03, 22:50:56.38(SYS4), 22:50:57.05, 22:51:37.39(SYS4), 22:51:39.07, 22:52:19.40(SYS4), 22:52:20.07, 22:53:01.08, 22:53:02.41(SYS4), 22:53:42.10, 22:53:44.43(SYS4), 22:57:45.18, 22:58:27.18, 22:59:09.19, 22:59:50.21, 22:59:52.53(SYS4)! Observing the SYS4 log around the same time, we see that the system detected an issue with a write to the CDS and waited for repair: Message IXC219E was issued one more time at 22:56:51.49, and then at 23:00:31.00 we see that XCF starts taking actions against the CDS since SYS1 never responded to the repair event: M C040000 SYS1 24283 23:00:31.00 00000090 IXC253I PRIMARY COUPLE DATA SET 693 D 693 00000090 PSYSS.PRODPLEX.LOGR.CDSD1 FOR LOGR D 693 00000090 IS BEING REMOVED BECAUSE OF INCONSISTENT INFORMATION E 693 00000090 DETECTED BY SYSTEM SYS2 Primary CDS finally removed at: M C000000 SYS1 24283 23:01:12.98 00000090 IXC263I REMOVAL OF THE PRIMARY COUPLE DATA SET 755 E 755 00000090 PSYSS.PRODPLEX.LOGR.CDSD1 FOR LOGR IS COMPLETE While messages indicating I/O issues with device 7702 where the alternate CDS resides were already observed even before that: And again several instances of that set of messages with not exactly the same pattern as the other device, but again quite the concerning amount: 22:59:59.53(SYS4), with the following entries being issued after primary CDS was removed - 23:03:59.28, 23:04:40.29, 23:07:14.33, 23:07:55.35, 23:08:37.36, 23:11:32.41, 23:12:13.42, 23:12:55.43!

Customer confirmed the connection is dedicated and the Ethernet ports on these 5200s are operating at 1 Gbps. The port speed needs to get to 10 Gbps. They were advised to check the speed on the switch ports and engage network support. Later, the customer confirmed they have updated the partnership settings on both clusters to compress data prior to sending it over the link.

IBM Support recommended replacing the SFP and the customer agreed. IBM Support created a work order for SFP replacement and the SFP was delivered to the customer. The customer confirmed the delivery and the case was closed. Resolution Summary Confirmed Solution Not Summarized: Mail send to: Mevlüt Dinç (Altyap?

The customer wants to ensure that specific volumes are synchronized between the production and disaster recovery sites. The customer has already set up a PBR (Point-in-Time Recovery) for this purpose. Feed Summary Customer is having issues with synchronization on their FlashSystem 7300. They have a consistency group called PRD2MAS that is in a consistent\_synchronized state on both clusters, but the synchronization stops randomly. The customer does not want to replace it with asynchronous PBR, but instead wants to know why the synchronization is stopping. The support agent suspects that the issue may be due to insufficient bandwidth for Metro Mirror or link dropping. The agent suggests changing the background copy rate to 50% to see if that resolves the issue. The customer agrees to monitor the systems to see if the synchronization problems persist. Resolution Summary Confirmed Solution Not Summarized Solution Attempts *Generated by watsonx*: 90% background copy rate seems to be too high as PBR (Policy-based Replication) is running over the same link.

I don't see any large / erroneous processes processes. Most virtual memory is used as Oracle, as expected, ~ 35.6 GB as private process memory and ~ 24 GB as shared memory. During normal / average workload hours an AIX based Oracle db system should not be using more than ~ 85% physical memory. It seems like this system was incorrectly sized in the first place. Considering current virtual memory usage at the time perfpmr was collected, this system should be configured with ~ 85 GB physical memory (73 * 100 / 85). Suggested --------- Please check with Oracle if such memory usage on this LPAR is as expected. If not, they should fix it. If such memory usage is expected, please assign additional 25 GB memory to this LPAR. Explanation ----------- AIX paging mechanism works so that once written to paging space, pages are not removed from paging space until one of the following happens: (1) the process associated with those pages terminates (in case of shared memory, ALL associated processes) (2) disclaim() system call is issued by that process (which applications usually don't do) (3) swapoff/swapon is executed (this requires more than one paging space configured) For long running processes (Oracle db processes are a typical example), even low levels of system paging will result in significant growth in paging space usage over time. As per above even if the system is only experiencing paging during occasional workload peaks (as already pointed out above, this might only happen on very rare occasions), this will cause constant increase in allocated paging space. Even though not used, paging space will stay allocated till owning processes exit or machine is rebooted or it is cleared by swapoff/swapon. Kernel also needs some small amount of paging space to create new processes (forking) so when it starts running out of paging space it will start killing processes to free some paging space. In case paging space is just allocated by long running processes, but not actually used, it is still not available and the system will sooner or later hang, or some cluster monitoring process will crash it before that (eviction). Therefore AIX Oracle db systems need enough physical memory to also accommodate workload peaks without paging to disk(s). ------------ I will be back with the 2nd RAC node data analysis -- skipped some lines - mail text was too long --------------------------",Missing information,edited,Closed by IBM,0,customer sentiment neutral description summary customer experiencing high paging memory issue aix oracle rac node leading system unresponsiveness restart lpars solution solution dba opened case oracle provided recommendation along performance data snap lpar vios analysis feed summary customer experiencing high paging memory issue two aix oracle rac node leading system unresponsiveness ibm support provided recommendation based data provided customer suggested increasing physical memory node however problem persisted even change oracle support suggested enabling jumbo frame adjusting mtu size ibm support confirmed done recommended oracle customer increased memory enabled jumbo frame adjusted mtu size system currently observation ibm support requested updated perfpmr data check current situation resolution summary confirmed solution summarized solution attempt summarized mail send sahmed hello ahmed reviewing configuration aix level time config run tue oct hostname model system id firmware version ibm memory size gb architecture mode frequency ghz number cpu number l cpu smt enabled true smt thread dedicated false capped false entitlement max capacity cpu number virtual cpu exceeds max capacity cpu processor folding enabled aix vrlm oslevel lvl memory overall size use virtual pinned free page gb attention memory committed paging size use page kdb vmm stats total available memory frame total unmanaged mem total virtual pgs total paging space used page page use working seg page use persistent page use client page pinned working seg page pinned persistent page pinned client page system kernel usage see problem checking application process usage program name command count private mb gb total oracle java ologgerd cvd orarootagent oneagentnetwo clmgrs cssdmonitor cssdagent tnslsnr process virtual pgsp e command pid nvpages private mb gb shared mb gb private mb gb shared mb gb total oracle ologgerd cvd java java oneagentnetwo oracle oracle java clmgrs summary virtual memory usage o application actually require gb physical memory committed see large erroneous process process virtual memory used oracle expected gb private process memory gb shared memory normal average workload hour aix based oracle db system using physical memory seems like system incorrectly sized first place considering current virtual memory usage time perfpmr collected system configured gb physical memory suggested please check oracle memory usage lpar expected fix memory usage expected please assign additional gb memory lpar explanation aix paging mechanism work written paging space page removed paging space one following happens process associated page terminates case shared memory associated process disclaim system call issued process application usually executed requires one paging space configured long running process oracle db process typical example even low level system paging result significant growth paging space usage time per even system experiencing paging occasional workload peak already pointed might happen rare occasion cause constant increase allocated paging space even though used paging space stay allocated till owning process exit machine rebooted cleared kernel also need small amount paging space create new process forking start running paging space start killing process free paging space case paging space allocated long running process actually used still available system sooner later hang cluster monitoring process crash eviction therefore aix oracle db system need enough physical memory also accommodate workload peak without paging disk back rac node data analysis skipped line mail text long
